Right now, I am deciding which tools to use to make my Freedom project with. I researched [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and also [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). I am deciding to make like a todo app/list. I was thinking that my project will contain like a organized schedule and like inside the todo list, the user can add stuff. For example, if the user wants to add " do chem homework," they can them press it and then it will appear a section where they can put details and when it is due. at the same time I was also thinking that they can have a section where they can see what they need to do during the week. This is a lot and very complex so I thought that firebase was the best option but I am still thinking. Right now I feel very complicated about this project but I will do it. I feel like if i can break this project into small sections and then work from there, I think I might accomplish this. I'm trying top have a growth mindset about this. I mean what's there to lose. If I don't make it, I can still gain knowledge about the tools I used.
